# Verification-of-Single-port-RAM

• Engaged in the validation of a single port RAM through the application of the MARCH-C test algorithm, addressing diverse corner cases and fault categories such as stuck-at, transition, stuck-open, and coupling faults. • Formulated and executed thorough memory testing methodologies aimed at guaranteeing the reliability and integrity of the RAM module, showcasing adeptness in reducing test complexity (10n) through the implementation of March-C.
